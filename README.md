- ## I am [Chandan Kumar Pradhan](www.linkedin.com/in/chandan-kumar-pradhan-0788361a0). An RPA Enthusiast. I have enrolled the previous IDTC RPA Tech camp organized by **IncubateIND** associated with **UIPath**. I loved that, learned something new and see i am here again to learn in another IDTC RPA tech camp associated with **UIPath** & **WonderBotz** organized by the same.

- ## Really I learned about **Robotic Process Automation** from my mentor [Nisarg Kadam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nisargkadam/) and  [Parth Doshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parth-doshi-learning-by-doing/). Thanks for conducting this kind of tech camps [Anuj Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anujsharma378/), [Kaushik Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kroy96/).
- ## I did today's task successfully but yes it's tricky and somewhat easy😀.
